[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wdonet/designPatternsOOP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wdonet/designPatternsOOP)

Design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. In other words, we can say that Design Pattern provides proven solution to solve commonly occurring problems in software (generally big) applications. The advantages of using them are listed below.

- Increases flexibility
- Facilitates maintainability
- Improves code's readability

Well, it's time to talk about:
> How **Design Patterns** in **Object Oriented Programming** work
> (with [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) code).

You'll find them organized by folder.  There in, you can see explanation at their own **Readme.md** and working **code** with best practices and tips.

Hopefully the explanation is plenty and the code, simple and clear for the majority of us.
