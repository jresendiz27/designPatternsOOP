# Chain of Responsibility Pattern (Behavioral)
> Gives more than one object the chance to handle a request by linking receiving objects together .

## Problem
- Writing any application you could find that an object generated by one class needs to be handled by another one and maybe later by a new one.

## Solution
- Give the chance to several objects to handle the request by chaining them and pass the request along that chain.
- It allows an object to send a command without knowing what object will receive and handle it.

### Pros
- Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver.

### When to use it ?
- When multiple objects should handle a request and the handler doesn't need to be a specific kind.
- When the handler should be determined at runtime.

#### Examples

1. Handle of events generated from the keyboard and mouse in a windows system like Microsoft Windows or Mac OSX.
2. Exception handling systems, easily seen in the stack trace.
3. Servlet filters in JavaEE
4. Spring Security Filters
