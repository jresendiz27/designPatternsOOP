Singleton Pattern (Creational)

>  The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of 
access to it.

---
## Problem

There are many objects that we only need one of them, i.e.
- Thread pools
- Caches
- objects that handle preferences and registry settings, 

For many of these types of objects, if we were to instantiate more than one weâ€™d run into all 
sorts of problems like incorrect program behavior, overuse of resources, or inconsistent results

---
## Solution

the Singleton Pattern ensures one and only one object is instantiated for a given class also 
gives us a global point of access

---
## Characteristics

- Ensures you have at most one instance of a class in your application
- Provides a global access point to that instance
- Implementation of the design.pattern.singleton.Singleton Pattern makes use of a private constructor, a static method 
combined with a static variable (At least on Java based languages)
- Be aware of multithreading
- design.pattern.singleton.Singleton is created in a lazy/eager manner

## Actors

![Singleton UML](singletonUML.png)

- getInstance():  static method, so you can conveniently access this method from anywhere in your code using design.pattern.singleton.Singleton.getInstance(). 
- instance: The instance is a class variable which holds our one and only one instance of design.pattern.singleton.Singleton
- design.pattern.singleton.Singleton(): private constructor, so it's accessible only inside the class

---
## Applicability

Use Singleton pattern when:

- There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.

---
## Benefits

- Controlled access to sole instance
- The Singleton pattern is an improvement over global variables
